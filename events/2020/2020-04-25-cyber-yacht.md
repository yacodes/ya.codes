# VR Algorave on Cyber Yacht 

On April 25th [Violetta Postnova](http://www.violettapostnova.com/) and I performed on a [Cyber Yacht](https://hubs.mozilla.com/gjs2PEC/uxr-cyber-yacht) in WebVR space for the first time.
We were live-coding: Violetta was doing the graphics, and I was responsible for the music.

Violetta used [Hydra](https://hydra-editor.glitch.me/) video synthesizer for this performance.

A couple of days before the party [Olivia Jack](https://twitter.com/_ojack_) posted a [tweet](https://twitter.com/hydra_patterns/status/1253338101683912706)
with a sample of code for using video and image in Hydra.
So Violetta decided to use 8 videos as an input to the synthesizer. During the performance she modulated the video with oscillators and noise and added a couple effects.

Her VJ set received many positive comments during and after the performance.

You can check out the recording of her visuals:

I live-coded music using [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org/).

Before the performance, I've collected a library of samples and sample loops found on my hard drive. This time my preference fell on aggressive and atonal sounds.

I've also updated my [configuration](https://github.com/yacodes/2020-04-25-cyber-yacht/blob/master/Boot.hs) for TidalCycles.
This new configuration included shortcuts of functions that I use more often than others and a couple of new useful functions for working with sample loops.

I've loaded all the final code and configuration for this performance to [Github](https://github.com/yacodes/2020-04-25-cyber-yacht).

There is also a video from inside the Cyber Yacht, recorded by CNDSD:

There were a lot of incredible performances by talented live-coders from all around the world: CNDSD, Char Stiles, Hernani Villase√±or, Alexandra Cardenas, Niklas Reppel, Pixelpusher and others.

We did not have time to listen to all the performers, because the event was pretty late Moscow time. Performances we liked the most:
* [Niklas Reppel](https://parkellipsen.de/) with his [Megra](https://github.com/the-drunk-coder/megra) mini-language;
* [Char Stiles](http://charstiles.com/) live-coding shaders;
* [Pixelpusher](http://pixelist.info/) with his [Liveprinter](https://github.com/pixelpusher/liveprinter) tool.

This party was organized by [Toplap Mexico](https://www.facebook.com/toplap.mx/) and [Toplap Berlin](https://www.facebook.com/groups/toplapnodeberlin). Thanks a lot for that, we had a lot of fun!

The yacht was developed by developers from UXR.Zone in VR chatroom environment [Hubs](https://hubs.mozilla.com/) by Mozilla.
UXR.Zone has many other clubs besides the Cyber Yacht: The Circle and The Dome. Check them out on [UXR.Zone](https://www.uxr.zone/) website.

We liked the performance. Violetta had an amazing VJ set. I've enjoyed playing with TidalCycles. But I wanna take my performance to the next level:
* Switch faster and sharper between musical patterns;
* Use Supercollider's synthesizers instead of samples;
* Use the TidalCycles functions to create patterns: binary, euclid, ascii.
